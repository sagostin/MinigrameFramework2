- **Plugin Info**
This is a events plugin that runs 24/7 on all of our servers. Some events will be money based (those will mainly be ran manually) but there needs to be an option for money based events.
Tournaments with configurable prizes and multiple different minigame types.

**This plugin will be an absolute fucking game changer if made properly. I will be marketing and advertising this as a core feature, and this will end up being a feature that can potentially bring thousands of Competitive Skyblock players in from the established servers.** 

**Backend**
» Hooks into cash eco
» MongoDB + Redis
» Whenever a player wins money plugin will log. Can we get this connected to our NodeJS discord bot? theres probably an API that can do it easily
» Json as flatfile storage
» Commands are /cashevents | /events | /event | /viewevent | /viewevents | etc
» Initial usage of that command ^ will bring:

&6&l&nCASH&a&l &nEVENTS&r

&6&lYour Stats (&fX event wins&6&l)

&e&lNext Event In.. &70d 0h 0m 0s
   &e&l* &eGamemode: &fx
   &e&l* &eTop Potential Prize: &2&l$&ax
   &e&l* &eLowest Potential Prize: &2&l$&ax

**Minigames**
- » Randomly selected
» Cash prizes from $0 to $50 depending on the game
» We will be able to configurate each event and what time it runs, the potential cash prize, max players, and how many arenas 
» Will have a timer / schedule built in

    FREE FOR ALL

    These are all very popular minigames (youtube them if you are having trouble) so I have no preference on how they are coded, just make sure to stick to our color format of &6&l(&f&l!&a&l) &fThis is text and &ethis is a heading&f and &e&lthis is a bigger heading&f.

    I will try to look for any minigame APIs on spigot that will fit our needs.

    Next we will have two more unique Minigames.
    They will be very unique.
    Some of the most unique Minigames.
    Frankly you have never seen anything like these Minigames.

    They will be released as future content updates.
